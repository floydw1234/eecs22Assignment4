my program uses variables to keep travk of 2 things.
it keeps track of the current killer and the victim. this
continues until there is only one person left in the array. 

To increment I noticed that no i++ statement was really safe because if could be making 
the index go out of bounds. So I replaced all those statements with an if else statement to make sure
that the array would never go out of the indexes of the indexes of the array.

To make the extra points thing work I just kept an array that taillied all of the peoples kills
and then found the maximum value of the array after the killling was done.
